				<h2>Microsoft Office Knowledge Base</h2><img src="images/microsoft_logo.png" alt="KBs" class="responsive"><br>
				<h3>Introduction</h3><p>The Microsoft Knowledge Base has more than 150,000 articles. These articles were created by thousands of support professionals who have resolved issues for our customers. The Microsoft Knowledge Base is regularly updated, expanded, and refined to help make sure that you have access to the very latest information.<br>Using keywords and query words in Knowledge Base articles may help you find the content that you are looking for more quickly. This article lists some of the most frequently used keywords and query words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.</p><br>
				<h3>More Information</h3><p>You can use the Microsoft Knowledge Base search options to customize your search. To learn more about these settings, visit the following Microsoft Web site: http://support.microsoft.com/search.<br>Some articles have the "Keywords" and "Additional query words" sections. When you use words in either of these sections to search the Knowledge Base, you may find articles that contain similar content. To use these words in your search, select your product from the drop-down list box, and then enter the keyword or query word that is specific to the content you want to find in the Search for box.If the query words and keywords that you use in your search do not return the results that you expect, also use other keywords and query words.</p><br>

				<h2>Zscaler Knowledge Base </h2><img src="images/Zscaler.png" alt="KBs" class="responsive"><br>
				<h3>Zscaler Product Name Change</h3>
				<p>Zscaler is changing the following product names within our services:<br><ul><li>Zscaler App (Z App) is changing to Zscaler Client Connector</li>
				<li>ZIA Zscaler Enforcement Node (ZIA ZEN) is changing to ZIA Public Service Edge</li><li>ZPA Zscaler Enforcement Node (ZPA ZEN) is changing to ZPA Public Service Edge</li></ul>These new names are not the result of changes in the product, nor will they affect users or administrators in any way. They simply identify these technologies more appropriately as our services expand and further enable our customers to work-from-anywhere, securely connecting users on any device to the internet, cloud applications, and private applications in the cloud or data center.</p><br>
				<h3>What is Zscaler Private Access?</h3><p>The Zscaler Private Access (ZPA) service enables organizations to provide access to internal applications and services while ensuring the security of their networks. ZPA is an easier to deploy, more cost-effective, and more secure alternative to VPNs. Unlike VPNs, which require users to connect to your network to access your enterprise applications, ZPA allows you to give users policy-based secure access only to the internal apps they need to get their work done. With ZPA, application access does not require network access.<br>While ZPA is for connecting users to an enterprise's internal applications, Zscaler Internet Access (ZIA) is for connecting users to public applications on the internet.The PAS solution architecture consists of two major elements. One is the Storage Engine, which holds the data and is responsible for securing the data at rest and ensuring authenticated and controlled access.</p><br>
